## About The Project

This project represents a web application allowing to automatically detect
the dual identity of customers.

It therefore sets up a facial recognition system through an application, allowing fraud to be detected.
customers of a bank.

The realization of this application is done in two phases:

- The modeling part: it consisted in detecting and extracting faces as well as other information
relating to the client. Then, after preprocessing the data, using advanced deep learning methods,
we used Transfer learning to associate a matrix representation with each image, after which we built a model.

- The software engineering part: It consisted in developing a rest backend API for the management of services and a part
frontend for the communication interfaces, thus allowing the production of the built model.

This is just the backend repository, the frontEnd part is in another repository
